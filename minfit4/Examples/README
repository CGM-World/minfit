these two example systems show two extremes of the fitting.

EX1/ - an old standby favorite system that fits quickly and clearly
EX2/ - this systems is a humdinger saturated system for which no sat
       regions are defined; as the fit unfolds, it appears that the
       model is going very bad, but minfit recovers and does a descent
       job on this
